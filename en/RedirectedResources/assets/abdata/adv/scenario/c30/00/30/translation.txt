「この滝はパワースポットになってるらしいね」=“I heard that this waterfall is a power spot.”
「あーなんとなくわかるかも、力強さを感じるのよね」=“I think I know what you mean... there's a powerful feeling here.”
「だね。滝そのものもだけど、この自然全体がそう感じさせるのかもなぁ」=“That's right. It's just not the waterfall itself, but it's all of nature that might make me feel this way.”
「折角だし、ここでいっぱいパワー貰っていきましょ？」=“Well, since we're here, shouldnt we draw a lot of power from this place?”
「そうだね、もう少しゆっくりしていこっか」=“That's right. Let's take it a little slower.”
