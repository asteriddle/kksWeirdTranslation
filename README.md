# kksWeirdTranslation

A not-so-faithful fan translation project for Koikatsu Sunshine

## Description

The mangled auto translation of storymode is a hot mess so I'm fixing it in my own way. This is a non-faithful 'translation'/localization intended to make the following changes;
* De-gender the protagonist and general setting, so playing as a female/nonbinary MC is less weird.
* Change name order where needed, characters by default should refer to you by first name, localization style.
* Detatch the game from the original's story. What school trip? That's silly, you're an adult.
* Change the more creepy dialogue. I don't like it.
* Add stupid references because I do what I want
   Text will obviously conflict with the Japanese voices - but I'm hoping you won't pay too much attention to that.

   I am aware of how text heavy this game is. I'm simply a bit silly.

   As of right now there is no official EN release so I don't have to put 'it may not work in the Steam version' because there is no steam version. Yet.

## Progress

## Help & Contributions

   I'm embarassingly dyslexic, feel free to poke me if you find a typo (or 20).  
This is mostly meant as a silly personal writing thing, but in the case of typos/grammar you're free to make corrections and do a pull request.

   Feel free to fork and make your own changes too. It's your oyster, or whatever. Also feel free to steal any translations that are on the more faithful side of things for your own project if you want, credit is optional but it'd be nice.
