# kkWeirdTranslation

A not-so-faithful fan translation project for Koikatsu Sunshine

## Description

The mangled auto translation of storymode is a hot mess so I'm fixing it in my own way. This is a non-faithful 'translation' intended to make the following changes;
* De-gender the protagonist and general setting, so playing as a female/nonbinary MC is less weird.
* Possibly de-gender the characters added to be wooed as well? If someone creates a character intended to not be a woman I guess.
* Detatch the game from the original's story. What school trip, that's silly, you're an adult.
* Change creepy dialogue. I don't like it.
* Add stupid references because I do what I want
   Text will obviously conflict with the Japanese voices - but I'm hoping you won't pay too much attention to that.

   I am aware of how text heavy this game is. I'm simply a bit silly.

   As of right now there is no official EN release so I don't have to put 'it may not work in the Steam version' because there is no steam version. Yet.
